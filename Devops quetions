#1# what do you understand by  statefull and stateless application?
Stateful Application:

In a stateful application, the application keeps track of the state or data associated with a user's interactions or sessions.
It maintains information about the user's actions and the current context throughout the session.

Stateless Application:

In a stateless application, each request from a client to the server is treated independently, and the server does not store any information about the client's previous requests or interactions.
Stateless applications do not maintain session-specific data or context between requests.
